Step by Step explanation on the project of Docker 

* clone the repository
    git clone 
* Containerize and run the training of the ML model
    updated the dockerfile.train: see Dockerfile.train
* Containerize and run the serving of the ML model
    updated the dockerfile.infer: see Dockerfile.infer

* Run the 2 containers:
    For the command see the dockerfiles
    i created a folder "app" with a subfolder "models" and copied the train.py and Server.py to the app folder
    to ensure the containers were able to find the codes.
    i mounted the containers to the same folder because the trainer container creates
    a model pickle file that the second container who serves the model needs to correctly work

* checking if the containers worked correctly
    after the "trainer container" i see the model pickle file available in the "models" subfolder (locally)
    after the "server container" i could access http://localhost:8080 and saw the welcome message
    and i could test the prediction of the model with a curl command (see dockerfile.infer)

* Store the Docker images
    i submitted the 2 images to my docker hub by first creating a tag (docker tag) for each image
    and then use 
    "docker push ilseclv/train_ml:v01-amd64"
    "docker push ilseclv/infer_ml:v01-amd64"

* Store the dockerfiles on github
    i committed the local folder with the updated dockerfiles
    git add
    git commit -m ""
    git push

* Build an apptainer image
    on the HPC, i created a shell script using:
        nano project_microcredential.sh 
        see github or the submitted zip folder for the file
        i included a command to pull and build the docker images i have on dockerhub:
        "apptainer build ./train_ml.sif docker://ilseclvd/train_ml:v01-amd64"
    and used the following command to submit the job
    SBATCH project_microcredential.sh
    note i couldn't submit the job to donphan, my only option was doduo.
    note also in my first attempt it didn't work and i received an error on compatibility
    because i build the docker images on mac and they couldn't be build on linux with apptainer
    i therefore had to build them again with a platform option to make it compatible


* save the shell script and slurm log file to github
    i cloned the github repository on my scratch space on the HPC
    i copied the shell script (project_microcredential.sh) and the slurm log file (slurm-59942816.out) 
    to the git directory 
    i added and committed, but to push i had to create a token on github:
    settings>Developper settings>personal token access>create new token  

* zipfile
    i pulled the updates from github (made by pushing from the HPC) to have the files locally,
    and created a zipfile from my final directory
